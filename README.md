# Personal_News_Widget

# Description
Personalized news widget created using praw and tkinter

# Dependencies
Python 3.4+

# Description
The script takes the top 8 links from several newsworthy subreddits (/r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/futurology, /r/canada) and organizes them into idividual tabs with buttons leading to a hyperlink of each article.

There is a refresh button at the bottom of the widget that takes the latest 8 articles from the aforementioned subreddits, which is useful for when the widget was opened for too long and there is a new set of top 8 articles on those subreddits.
